**Tired of missing diamonds or accidentally digging into gravel?**

> Veinify works fully on its own. For players who want the best mining experience, it can optionally be paired with [**Photon Fullbright**](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/photon-fullbright) to make the world completely bright.

## Features
- Clearer ores that stand out in caves and deepslate  
- Gravel is easier to spot, preventing accidental cave-ins and suffocations  
- Subtle visual improvements that keep the vanilla aesthetic  
- Fully server-friendly, no glowing ores or x-ray effects  

---

## Why Veinify?
Mining can be tedious when ores are hard to see. Veinify helps you spend less time squinting in dark caves and more time actually enjoying Minecraft. It’s simple, effective, and natural-looking.
